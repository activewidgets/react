# Introduction

ActiveWidgets is a developer-friendly multi-framework datagrid component library for the web. It is built for the performance-critical enterprise applications with complex screens and very large datasets. Yet the library tries to remain compact and simple and allows writing code that everyone can understand and maintain.

ActiveWidgets 3.0 is designed from the ground up to take advantage of the capabilities of a modern browser and deliver better, faster, less complex and more reliable product.

## Frameworks support
